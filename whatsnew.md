# What's New in IBM Cloud Foundry Enterprise Environment

This document describes what's new in each version released up to this date of the {{site.data.keyword.cfee_full_notm}} service.

## Version 2.1.0
{: #v210}

_Release Date:_ 2019-02-20

**Note:** You can only update to this version from version **2.0.2**. Update to version 2.0.2 before updating to version v2.1.0.

The following changes were released in version 2.1.0 of the {{site.data.keyword.cfee_full_notm}} service (CFEE). To update your CFEE's version, go to the **Updates and Scaling** page in the CFEE's user interface and click **Update**:

* New autoscaling capability that automatically scales Cloud Foundry application instances based on custom rules. Autoscaling is accessible from the CLI and from the Stratos console. The Stratos console can be optionally installed and launched from the _Overview_ page in the CFEE user interface. In the _Applications_ page of the Stratos console, select an  application and look for the **Auto Scaling** tab. Click *Create Policy* to launch the autoscaling editor to define the scaling policy for the target application.
  See the [autoscaling documentation](https://dev.console.test.cloud.ibm.com/docs/cloud-foundry-public?topic=cloud-foundry-public-autoscale_cloud_foundry_apps#autoscale_cloud_foundry_apps) for more information.
* New capability to manage buildapcks from the user interface, including drag-and-drop positioning of a buildpack in the priority list. The capability is available in a new **Buildpacks** page of the CFEE user interface.
* New capability to manage organization quotas from the user interface, including visualizing which organizations are using a specific quota. The capability is available in a new **Quotas** page in the CFEE user interface. You can create new quotas and edit existing ones. You can also update the values of the default quota with the values from any existing quota by invoking the **Copy to Default** from the quota's menu.
* A new **Getting Started** page in the user interface guides users to the most important tasks to setup and use the environment.
* **Tags** can be added to a CFEE instance in the IBM Cloud resource list.  Tags added in the resource list will also appear in the header of the CFEE overview page.
* Security patch for Stratos console. Note that updating the CFEE version will not apply this patch. You need to delete and re-install the Stratos console, which automatically picks the latest Stratos console version containing the patch.

**Note:** If you update to v2.1.0 from a v2.0.x version, the update takes place with a single _Update_ action that automatically updates both, the control plane and the cells in sequence. If you update from a v1.x.x version, the update requires two separate _Update_ actions, one for updating the control plane (first), and one for updatting the cells.

## Version 2.0.2
{: #v202}

_Release Date:_ 2019-02-08

The following changes were released in version 2.0.2 of the {{site.data.keyword.cfee_full_notm}} service (CFEE). To update your CFEE's version, go to the _Updates and Scaling_ page in the CFEE's user interface:

* Resolved problems preventing successful version updates. This version is a pre-req for updating to version **2.1.0**


## Version 2.0.1
{: #v201}

_Release Date:_ 2019-01-10

The following changes were released in version 2.0.1 of the {{site.data.keyword.cfee_full_notm}} service (CFEE). To update your CFEE's version, go to the _Updates and Scaling_ page in the CFEE's user interface:

* Resolved problem that prevents custom domains from working properly.
* Resolved problem whereby organization metrics are not available while new metrics are retrieved.


## Version 2.0.0
{: #v200}

_Release Date:_ 2018-12-13

The following changes were released in version 2.0.0 of the {{site.data.keyword.cfee_full_notm}} service (CFEE). To update your CFEE's version, go to the _Updates and Scaling_ page in the CFEE's user interface:

* Improved CFEE version update resiliency.
* Improvements to the operational availability and resiliency of CFEE instances.
* Client side certificates for more secured access to applications, allowing the server to grant application access only to certified clients.
* When a CFEE instance is created, the supporting Kubernetes cluster and Cloud Object Storage service instance are now created in the same Resource Group as the CFEE service instance (instead of under the "Default" resource group).
* Security patch.
* Improvements to the `ibmcloud cfee` CLI:
    * New commands for creating an IBM Cloud service instance from a CFEE space and adding it to that CFEE space (`ibmcloud cfee service-create`, `ibmcloud cfee service-alias-create`).
    * New commands for scaling the capacity of a CFEE (`ibmcloud cfee scale-up`, `ibmcloud cfee scale-down`).
    * Improvements to the command for managing CFEE instances (`ibmcloud cfee environments`).
    
      Update the ibmcloud CLI (`ibmcloud update`) to access these command enhancements, and issue `ibmcloud cfee -help` for more details.
      
**Note**: Updating a CFEE instance to version 2.0.0 only requires a single _update_ action that updates both, the control plane and the cells. No separate updates are required for the CFEE control plane and cells.

The following changes were released in version 1.1.0 of the {{site.data.keyword.cfee_full_notm}} service:

* New capabilities:
   * CFEE instances can be provisioned on [virtual-dedicated](https://console.bluemix.net/docs/containers/cs_clusters.html#clusters#clusters_ui_standard) Kubernetes worker nodes hosted on infrastructure that is devoted to your IBM Cloud account.
   * A new data center in Tokyo (tok05) is available for provisionng CFEE instances.
   * [Updating](https://console.bluemix.net/docs/cloud-foundry/updating-scaling.html#update-scale#update) a CFEE instance to a new version.
   * [Scaling](https://console.bluemix.net/docs/cloud-foundry/updating-scaling.html#update-scale#scale) the capacity of a CFEE instance by adding or deleting Cloud Foundry cells.
   * [Auditing](https://console.bluemix.net/docs/cloud-foundry/auditing-logging.html#auditing-logging#auditing) Cloud Foundry activities through integration with an automatically configured IBM Cloud Activity Tracker service instance.
   * Persisting Cloud Foundry [log events](https://console.bluemix.net/docs/cloud-foundry/auditing-logging.html#auditing-logging#logging) through an automatically configured IBM Cloud Log Analysis service instance.
   * Health Check view that indicates the operational status of CFEE components.
   * New commands to perform CFEE related actions on the command line interface (CLI):
     * `ibmcloud cfee create`, `ibmcloud cfee create-locations`, and `ibmcloud cfee create-status` commands to create CFEE instances from the command line interface, get a list of available data centers where a CFEE can be provisioned, and check the provisioning status of a CFEE being created.
     * `ibmcloud cfee create-permission-get` and `ibmcloud cfee create-permission-set`  [commands](https://console.bluemix.net/docs/cloud-foundry/permissions.html#permissions#permcli-creating) to retrieve and set the permissions required to create CFEE instances. The commands aggregate and simplify the setting of permissions for the CFEE service and for the required supporting services.
     * `ibmcloud catalog blacklist` command to simplify [visibility control](https://console.bluemix.net/docs/cloud-foundry/add-serv-inst.html#workingwith-services#service_visibility) of IBM Cloud services for users in an IBM Cloud account.

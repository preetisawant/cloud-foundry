# Liberty for Java
{: #liberty_runtime}

Liberty for Java applications on {{site.data.keyword.Bluemix}} are powered by the liberty-for-java buildpack. The liberty-for-java buildpack provides a complete runtime environment for running Jakarta EE, Eclipse MicroProfile, Java EE, and OSGi applications on top of WebSphere Liberty. It supports popular frameworks like Spring and includes the {{site.data.keyword.IBM_notm}} JRE. Liberty enables rapid application development that is well suited to the cloud.

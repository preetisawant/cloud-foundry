# Best practices for running apps in production
{: #production}

Cloud Foundry is an excellent platform for running cloud-ready applications in production. These best practices can help with running production Cloud Foundry apps with {{site.data.keyword.Bluemix_notm}}.
{:shortdesc}

## Multiple instances
{: #multiple_instances}

Cloud-ready apps are horizontally scalable, and are therefore able to dynamically add or remove application instances. Run at least three instances of each application to help avoid unexpected downtime in the event of isolated incidents or platform maintenance.

## Monitoring options
{: #monitoring}

{{site.data.keyword.Bluemix_notm}} makes it easy to monitor your application with services like [Monitoring and Analytics](/docs/services/monana/index.html) and [New Relic ![External link icon](../icons/launch-glyph.svg)](http://newrelic.com/){: new_window}. Check out [Integrated logging capabilities](../monitor_log/logging.html#logging_for_bluemix_apps) for more information.

## Support options
{: #support}
